* web org-mode from s3 - WOMF-S3

This simple ruby/sinatra application can be hosted in heroku-like environment to give you web access to your org-mode files hosted in one of your S3 buckets.

It means that you have to already use S3 and stash your emacs org-mode files there. For cli I recommend s3cmd or s3fs and for your mobile device go with MobileOrg and S3 Anywhere. 

In this way you can have access to your org-mode files on any device, computer, mobile and web.

Of course it works on any text files, but what's the point?
